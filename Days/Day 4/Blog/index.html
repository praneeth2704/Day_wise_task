    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>
      Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, had 2 main influential
      fathers in his life. Poor Dad was Kiyosaki’s biological father, a man who
      was highly intelligent and very well educated. Poor Dad believed in
      studying hard and getting good grades, then finding a well-paying job.
      Yet, despite these seemingly positive attributes, Poor Dad didn’t do well
      financially. Rich Dad was the father of Kiyosaki’s best friend. He had a
      similar work ethic to Kiyosaki’s real dad, but with a twist. Rich Dad
      believed in financial education, learning how money works, and
      understanding how to make money work for you. Although he was an
      eighth-grade dropout, Rich Dad eventually became a millionaire by putting
      the power of money to work for him. The book is written from Kiyosaki’s
      perspective of how Rich Dad went about making money and the mistakes that
      Poor Dad made. The first 6 chapters of Rich Dad Poor Dad make up about
      two-thirds of the book and discuss the 6 lessons that Kiyosaki learned
      from his Rich Dad.

    <h2 id="chap1"><u>chapter 1: The Rich Don’t Work for Money</u></h2>
    <p>
      Oftentimes people misunderstand the title of this chapter, and mistakenly
      believe that it means the rich don’t work. In fact, the complete opposite
      is true. Instead of reading the chapter title as “The Rich Don’t Work for
      Money”, what Kiyosaki means to say is that “The Rich Don’t Work for
      Money.” Note that by putting the emphasis on the word “money,” this
      section takes on an entirely different meaning. The truth is that the
      majority of rich people do work very hard, but they go about it
      differently than most people do. Rich people—and people who want to become
      rich—work and learn every day how to put money to work for them. As Rich
      Dad says, “The poor and middle class work for money. The rich have money
      work for them.” Kiyosaki also notes that having a regular job is just a
      short-term solution to the long-term problem (or challenge) of creating
      wealth and financial freedom: “It’s fear that keeps most people working at
      a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the
      fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That’s the
      price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for
      money. Most people become a slave to money—and then get angry at their
      boss.”

    <h2 id="chap2"><u>chapter 2: Why teach financial literacy?</u></h2>
    <p>
      The second chapter of Rich Dad Poor Dad explains the difference between an
      asset and a liability. Chapter 2 drives home the point that it’s not about
      how much money you make, but about how much money you keep. An asset is
      something that has value, that produces income or appreciates, and has a
      market where the asset can easily be bought and sold: Assets produce
      income Assets appreciate Assets do both Conversely, liabilities take money
      out of your pocket because of the costs associated with them. When Rich
      Dad Poor Dad was first published back in 1997, Kiyosaki created a lot of
      controversy with this statement. That’s because by definition, a personal
      residence isn’t an asset unless it appreciates enough to offset the costs
      of ownership. On the other hand, rental property is an asset because it
      can generate enough passive income to exceed the expenses of operating and
      financing the real estate. As Kiyosaki writes in Chapter 2 of Rich Dad
      Poor Dad, “Want to grow rich? Concentrate your efforts on buying
      income-producing assets – when you truly understand what an asset is. Keep
      liabilities and expenses low. You’ll deepen your asset column.”

    <h2 id="chap3"><u>chapter 3: Mind your own business</u></h2>
    <p>
      There are 2 key messages in this chapter. First, pay off your debts and
      start investing in income-producing assets as soon as possible. Next, stay
      financially healthy by spending your time (instead of your paycheck) and
      investing as much of your money as possible in assets. Kiyosaki notes in
      Chapter 3 of Rich Dad Poor Dad that most people confuse their profession
      with their business. In other words, they spend their entire lives working
      in somebody else’s business and making other people rich. One of my
      favorite quotes from this section is: “The primary reason the majority of
      the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative is that they have no
      financial foundation. They have to cling to their jobs and play it safe.
      They can’t afford to take risks.”

    <h2 id="chap4"><u>chapter 4: The history of taxes and the power of corporations</u></h2>
    <p>
      When reading this chapter, it’s important to keep in mind that Kiyosaki
      wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad as a motivational book, not to provide expert
      financial or tax advice. For example, Kiyosaki writes about the time he
      bought a Porsche and treated it as a business expense, using before-tax
      dollars. Buying a high-end luxury car when a much less expensive make and
      model would do could put an investor on the fast track to an IRS audit.
      But putting the Porsche aside, the points made in this chapter discuss how
      to play the investment game smart. The rich understand the power of
      company structures and the tax code and use every legal means they can to
      minimize their tax burden. Compare how business owners and investors with
      corporations such as C corps, S corps, or LLCs pay taxes to how most
      people pay tax: Business owners with a corporate structure: Earn Spend Pay
      taxes Employees who work for corporations: Earn Pay taxes Spend Notice
      that employees who work for somebody else spend their money post-tax,
      while business owners earn and spend before paying tax. Chapter 4 of the
      book also covers the 4 main components of what Kiyosaki calls “Financial
      IQ”: Accounting, Investment Strategy, Market Law, and Law. As Rich Dad
      Poor Dad reminds us, understanding the legal and tax advantages
      significantly contribute to building long-term wealth: “For instance, a
      corporation can pay expenses before paying taxes, whereas an employee gets
      taxed first and must try to pay expenses on what is left. . . Corporations
      also offer legal protection from lawsuits. When someone sues a wealthy
      individual, they are often met with layers of legal protection and often
      find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing [in their own name].
      They control everything, but [personally] own nothing.”

      Inventing money means finding opportunities or deals that other people
      don’t have the skill, knowledge, resources, or contacts for. In Chapter 5,
      Rich Dad Poor Dad explains there are 2 types of investors: Investment
      packages are bought by people who entrust their money to a developer or
      fund manager. This is the way that most people invest, such as buying
      shares of an ETF or putting money into a real estate crowdfunding venture.
      Professional investors look after their own investments, research the
      market to find deals that make sense, then hire professionals to manage
      the daily oversight. Professional investors have 3 things in common:
      Identify opportunities that other people have not found Raise funds for
      investment Work with other intelligent people Here’s one of my favorite
      closing thoughts from this chapter: “Some people argue that there aren’t
      real estate bargains where they are, but there are prime opportunities
      everywhere that are overlooked. Most people aren’t trained financially to

      everywhere that are overlooked. Most people aren’t trained financially to
      recognize the opportunities in front of them.”
      Inventing money means finding opportunities or deals that other people
      don’t have the skill, knowledge, resources, or contacts for. In Chapter 5,
      Rich Dad Poor Dad explains there are 2 types of investors: Investment
      packages are bought by people who entrust their money to a developer or
      fund manager. This is the way that most people invest, such as buying
      shares of an ETF or putting money into a real estate crowdfunding venture.
      Professional investors look after their own investments, research the
      market to find deals that make sense, then hire professionals to manage

      Poor Dad was intelligent and well educated and worked for money because
      job security meant everything to him. Rich Dad became a millionaire by
      working to learn. As Kiyosaki writes: “I recommend to young people to seek
      work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn. Look down
      the road at what skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific
      profession and before getting trapped in the Rat Race.” In fact, that’s
      exactly what Kiyosaki did. He joined the Marines after graduating from
      college and learned the essential business skills of leading and managing
      people. After serving his country, Kiyosaki joined Xerox, overcame his
      fear of rejection to become one of the top 5 salespeople in the company,
      then left the corporate world to form his own business. Chapter 6 of Rich
